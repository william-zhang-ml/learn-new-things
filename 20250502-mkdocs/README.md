Just me figuring out how to serve nice-looking documentation.
I've found out that I like the pre-built ["Ivory" theme](https://github.com/daizutabi/mkdocs-ivory).
But ["Material"](https://github.com/squidfunk/mkdocs-material) is less buggy in terms of displaying search results and source code.

I used the following YouTube videos as reference.
- [How To Create STUNNING Code Documentation With MkDocs Material Theme - James Willett](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-YA_dA8C20)
- [Material for MkDocs: Full Tutorial To Build And Deploy Your Docs Portal - James Willett](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlABhbnNrfI)
