# learn-new-things

I'm a big fan of lifelong learning.
I'm also a big fan of keeping track of notes and past work.
This purpose of this repo is for me to learn new things,
take notes as I go, and keep code snippets all in one place.
I often branch out and learn things that are not immeadiately relevant,
but may be relevant in the future.
Thus, future me will likely appreciate having an archive to reference.
